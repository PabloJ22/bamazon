Bamazon Store

A Node.js and MySQL app allowing the customer to view an inventory of items for purchase and select the item he/she would like to buy through reference to the Product ID Number (the chronological numbers located on the left-most side of the table). As long as there is enough inventory for the purchase, the system will proceed with the purchase, notifying the customer of the total price, and thereafter informing the customer of the remaining inventory.
