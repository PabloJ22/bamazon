Bamazon Store

A Node.js and MySQL app that provides three separate viewing platforms depending on user type: customer, manager, or supervisor.

The customer can view an inventory of items for purchase and select the item he/she would like to buy through reference to the Product ID Number (the chronological numbers located on the left-most side of the table). As long as there is enough inventory for the purchase, the system will proceed with the purchase, notifying the customer of the total price, and thereafter informing the customer of the remaining inventory.

The manager will be able to view and mange inventory through purchase logs.

The supervisor will be albe to view and modify inventory and purchase logs, as well as submit orders for items with low inventory.
